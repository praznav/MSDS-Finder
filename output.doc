In case of fire in the surroundings: all extinguishing agents allowed. EXPLOSION EXPOSURE PREVENT DISPERSION OF DUST! AVOID ALL CONTACT! INHALATION Burning sensation. Cough. Laboured breathing. Ventilation (not if powder). Fresh air, rest. Half-upright position. Refer for medical attention. SKIN Redness. Pain. Blisters. Protective gloves. Protective clothing. Remove contaminated clothes. Rinse skin with plenty of water or shower. Refer for medical attention. EYES Redness. Pain. Severe deep burns. Safety goggles, face shield. First rinse with plenty of water for several minutes (remove contact lenses if easily possible), then take to a doctor. INGESTION Burning sensation. Sore throat. Abdominal cramps. Weakness. Do not eat, drink, or smoke during work. Rinse mouth. Do NOT induce vomiting. Refer for medical attention. SPILLAGE DISPOSAL STORAGE PACKAGING & LABELLING Sweep spilled substance into containers. Wash away remainder with plenty of water (extra personal protection: P1 filter respirator for inert particles). Separated from strong acids. Dry. SEE IMPORTANT INFORMATION ON BACK ICSC: 0983 Prepared in the context of cooperation between the International Programme on Chemical Safety & the Commission of the European Communities © IPCS CEC 1993 International Chemical Safety Cards TETRAPOTASSIUM PYROPHOSPHATE ICSC: 0983 I M P O R T A N T D A T A PHYSICAL STATE; APPEARANCE: ODOURLESS HYGROSCOPIC WHITE GRANULES OR POWDER. PHYSICAL DANGERS: CHEMICAL DANGERS: The solution in water is a medium strong base. Reacts with strong acids. OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE LIMITS (OELs): TLV not established. PDK not established. ROUTES OF EXPOSURE: The substance can be absorbed into the body by inhalation of dust. INHALATION RISK: Evaporation at 20°C is negligible; a harmful concentration of airborne particles can, however, be reached quickly if powdered. EFFECTS OF SHORT-TERM EXPOSURE: Corrosive. The substance is corrosive to the eyes, the skin and the respiratory tract. Corrosive on ingestion as well. Inhalation of aerosol may cause lung oedema (see Notes). EFFECTS OF LONG-TERM OR REPEATED EXPOSURE: PHYSICAL PROPERTIES Melting point: 1090°C Solubility in water: Very good (187 g/100 ml at 25°C) ENVIRONMENTAL DATA NOTES The symptoms of lung oedema often do not become manifest until a few hours have passed and they are aggravated by physical effort. Rest and medical observation are therefore essential. Immediate administration of an appropriate spray, by a doctor or a person authorized by him/her, should be considered.
